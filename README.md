# Memory-Game
Memory Game was a delight of our childhood.
This is a jQuery and javascript based Memory Game where you first get the option to enter the number of blocks/cards to get included in the game.
After clicking on the "Start Game" button, the cards display their images for a short period (5 seconds).
After 5 seconds, the cards become opaque, now you need to match identical cards in the pair of 2 cards each, and based on that, score and failed attempts are calculated.
